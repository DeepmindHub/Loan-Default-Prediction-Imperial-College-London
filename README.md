# Loan Default Prediction - Imperial College London

This is the script I used to create my submission to Kaggle's Loan Default Prediction - Imperial College London competition. For my best submission, I added a for loop within the main() function in order to average the results of 10 sets of models using multiple seeds. 


## Instructions

* Download data from competition website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/loan-default-prediction/
* Modify your working directory and/or path to python if needed.
* Run the "runLoan.py" file.
